stm32f4_usartlib
================

A C Library built on stm32f4 basic USART API to provide one instruction USART initialization and functionality

Description
-----------

 A simple C library that allows easier  usart usage in STM32F4 projects to help prototype products faster based on
 STM32F4 MCUs.
 
 This will allow initializing USART ports with a simple ONE LINE instruction such as:
 
        USARTInit( USART1, 115200);
  
 A demo main.c is included to help see how easier things become using this lib.
